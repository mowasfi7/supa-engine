# Mohamed Wasfi <small>Backend Engineer</small> #

Mohamed, or Wasfi as he likes to be called, is a cool cat. Friends call him "Fifi". You can call him Fifi too, but be prepared to be given a nickname of your own

Once upon a time, Wasfi was hungry. He wanted to get some yummy salad in his tummy, but knowing that salad doesn't grow on trees, Wasfi wanted to shop around. Not finding a single, unified place to compare the prices of his shopping list, he had an "Aha!" moment, and the site you see before you was born.

In his spare time, Wasfi likes to go on blister-inducing walks from coastal town to coastal town. He is also an avid collector of sci-fi/fantasy memorabilia. As soon as he gets his hands on Superman's undepants, his collection will be complete
