# Amanda Durkan <small>Frontend Designer and Developer</small> #

Amanda is a long time bagel enthuisast. It is her go-to bread. You may have noticed the inclusion of bagels somewhere on the front page? Get in contact if you spot it, you may even win a prize! (Disclaimer: You won't win a prize)

In her spare time, Amanda likes to breathe in fresh air and smell the rain on trees. She is also training to become a world class roller derby star, provided she can stop falling over every time she gets on skates

Amanda designed and developed the pretty UI you see here. Want to know more about the frontend technologies she used? Get in touch!
