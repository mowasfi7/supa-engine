# Marco Tsitselis <small>Business Leader</small> #

Marco is a high flying business man. He leads all of his meetings while on the move. If on the occassion that he has to sit down, he borrows a aeroplane figureen from Wasfi, just so he can feel like he's on the move. 

Marco loves movies. If he could pack it all in and become a movie star, he would, just so long as the director doesn't mind if he acts while on the move

In his spare time, Marco likes to wrestle tigers and purr at random passers by
